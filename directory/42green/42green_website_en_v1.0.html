                            <h1>The reasons for a greener digital</h1>
                                Today, the digital has real impacts on the environment and human societies.
                            <p>

                                    <li><strong>It emits greenhouse gases:</strong> 4% of the emissions worlwide, and we expect twice that number by 2025.</li>
                                    <li><strong>We often think the digital is dematerialized but it mobilizes a huge amount of ressources.</strong> For example, manufacturing a laptop requires about 800kg of material. Extracting and refining these ressources have dangerous consequences on the water, soil and air and on the population living nearby (competition to access fresh water, children forced labour, highly polluted environment etc.)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Electronic waste increases exponentially and is not managed properly:</strong> only 17% of our electronic waste worldwide enters legal recycling channels. The rest of it all ends up in landfill and/or is incinerated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ressources are getting scarcer and scarcer.</strong> The ressources shortages threathen our consumption of digital services and the acceleration of new usages goes beyond the pace our planet can sustain.</li>
                                </ul>

                            Digital technologies and services are a powerful tool for an environmental and social transition to a greener and fairer world. So they remain part of our everyday life and allies in making the world a better place, we need them to be sustainable.

                        <h1>What is the sustainable digital ?</h1>
                        According to the INR (<i>l'Institut du Numérique Reponsable</i>, the Sustainabe Digital Institude), the sustainability of the digital is about reducing the environmental and social footprint of the information and communication technologies. The four bases of this concept are:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Green for IT:</strong> let's reduce the environmental footprint of the digital.<br />
                                A concrete example of it would be to eco-conceive a digital service or software.</li>
                            <li><strong>IT for Green:</strong> let's reduce our own environmental footprint with the help of the digital.<br />
                                The French online carpooling marketplace Blablacar uses digital services to help people share vehicules and reduce the pollution their use produces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Human for IT:</strong> it's important to consider the people impacted by the manufacturing of our devices and the managing of the waste they become.<br />
                                This part is about applying control and regulation so the people manufacturing and recycling our digital equipments work in decent conditions according to their human rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>IT for Human:</strong> for the digital to serve social development.</li>
                        </ul>
